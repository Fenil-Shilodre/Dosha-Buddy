# ðŸ§˜ Dosha Buddy: Discover Your Prakruti

Welcome to Dosha Buddy, an application designed to help you discover your unique Ayurvedic constitution (Prakruti). Using modern technology, this tool analyzes your physical, mental, and emotional traits to determine your primary doshaâ€”whether you're primarily **Vata** (air & space), **Pitta** (fire & water), **Kapha** (earth & water), or a balanced combination.

This application offers two distinct methods for your assessment:
1.  **Conversational Discovery:** Engage in a natural, AI-driven chat. Share your experiences in your own words, and the AI will interpret your responses to identify your traits.
2.  **Structured Questionnaire:** Follow a traditional, guided assessment by answering specific multiple-choice questions about your characteristics.

No matter which path you choose, you'll receive a detailed analysis of your dosha percentages, an explanation of your constitution, and personalized wellness tips to help you find balance.
